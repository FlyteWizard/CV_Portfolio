# Hello!

My name is Dominique Charlebois 🐱 if you haven't guessed yet. I am in my 2nd/3rd year at UVic 🎉. I am studying Computer Science. I have completed an internship with a local startup, a work study with UVic, a pilot project with UVic, and a part-time remote employment with a local startup. 😊 I enjoy frontend development and design. 

Down below will be links to my social media, and my personal websites.

### Link to Websites

Here are my two websites. The first has been designed and created by me and the second is hosted by Tookapic.

My personal website has links to my social media and a link to my [resume](http://dominiquecharlebois.com/resume). It is mainly for Hiring Managers and people interested in my work.

The second website by Tookapic host all my daily photographs. It is a hobby that I truly enjoy. You are welcomed to check out my pictures.
