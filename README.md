# Hello!

My name is Dominique Charlebois üê± if you haven't guessed yet. I am in my 2nd/3rd year of education at UVic üéâ. I am in the engineering program following the computer science learning path. I have completed a co-op at a local startup, a work study with UVic, a pilot project with UVic, a part-time employment at a local startup, and I plan on doing more. üòä I enjoy frontend development and design. 

Down below will be links to my social media, and my personal websites. 

Feel free to stalk me on the internet!

### Link to Websites

Here are my two websites. The first has been designed and created by me and the second is hosted by Tookapic. Tookapic is a 365 Day Challange website where you can post daily pictures.

My personal website has links to my social media and a link to my [resume](http://dominiquecharlebois.com/resume). It is mainly for Hiring Managers and people interested in my work.

The second website by Tookapic host all my daily photographs. It is a hobby that I truly enjoy. You are welcomed to check out my pictures. But beware of "streak pics", some days aren't that glorious.
