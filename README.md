#Hello!

My name is Dominique Charlebois üê± if you haven't guessed yet. I am in my 2nd/3rd year of education at UVic üéâ. I am in the engineering program following the computer science learning path. I have completed a co-op at a local startup and I plan on doing more. üòä I enjoy frontend development and design. 

Down below will be links to my social media, my personal websites and my publications. 

Feel free to stalk me on the internet!

### Link to Websites

Here are my three websites. The first two have been designed and created by me and the third is hosted by Tookapic. Tookapic is a 365 Day Challange website where you can post daily pictures.

My personal website has links to my social media and a link to my [resume](http://dominiquecharlebois.com/resume.pdf). It is mainly for Hiring Managers and people interested in my work.

The teaching website is meant for learning. I post my learnings on Medium and create beginner friendly articles. You will find tutorials and course presentations on this website. 

The third website by Tookapic host all my daily photographs. It is a hobby that I truly enjoy. You are welcomed to check out my pictures. But beware of "streak pics", some days aren't that glorious.

I have some articles on Medium and some on Tookapic. AND I'm obviously not an expert, but I could be when I'm 102 years old and yelling at kids to get off my window.
